# **YATDS - Yet Another Top Down Shooter**

## Intro

This is my attempt to try to make a game purely with Javascript, and the HTML canvas, I wouldn't expect too much from it, I'm primarily building it to try to figure out some canvas stuff, so don't expect it to be well optimized or particularly polished.

## Controls

Arrow keys - Move your ship around</br>

## Debug Commands
The Following commands need to be put into the web console to work:

`stop()` - will halt the state machine and stop any future redraws</br>
`start()` -will restart the state machine where ever you left it when you stopped it
